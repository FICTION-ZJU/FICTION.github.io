Existing approaches to self-improvement often rely on external supervision signals in the form of seed data and/or assistance from third-party models. This paper presents Crescent -- a simple yet effective framework for generating high-quality synthetic question-answer data in a fully autonomous manner. Crescent first elicits the LLM to generate raw questions via a bait prompt, then diversifies these questions leveraging a rejection sampling-based self-deduplication, and finally feeds the questions to the LLM and collects the corresponding answers by means of majority voting. We show that Crescent sheds light on the potential of true self-improvement with zero external supervision signals for math reasoning; in particular, Crescent-generated question-answer pairs suffice to (i) improve the reasoning capabilities of an LLM while preserving its general performance (especially in the 0-shot setting); and (ii) distil LLM knowledge to weaker models more effectively than existing methods based on seed-dataset augmentation.","tags":["synthetic data","large language models","mathematics reasoning"],"title":"The Self-Improvement Paradox: Can Language Models Bootstrap Reasoning Capabilities without External Scaffolding?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siwei Tan","Liqiang Lu","Congliang Lang","Mingshuai Chen","Jianwei Yin"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1732579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1732579200,"objectID":"44d641e11515fb31127530b2a8f1b3fa","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/tan-jos2025/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tan-jos2025/","section":"publication","summary":"Current quantum programs are usually represented as quantum circuits, including various quantum gates. If the program contains gates that are represented as unitary matrices, these gates need to be transformed into quantum circuits composed of basic gates. However, current synthesis methods may generate inferior circuits with thousands of gates, which leads to failure when deploying to real-world quantum hardware. Moreover, the process to minimize the number of gate takes weeks or even months when the number of qubits goes to 8. In this work, we propose Fast-USYN that enables fast synthesis from unitary to high-quality quantum circuits. We first introduce an iterative approach that approximates the target unitary by inserting circuit blocks. The minimization of gates is achieved by a look-ahead strategy with a rewarding mechanism to reduce redundant gates. In the acceleration of unitary synthesis, instead of exhaustively enumerating tremendous candidates, we construct the search space by depicting the closure of each candidate. Furthermore, to reduce the overhead of searching the optimal gate parameters, we pack the selected candidates with the target unitary into a uniform circuit so that we can quickly obtain the approximation distance by calculating its expectation on the ground state. Experiments show that Fast-USYN achieves 1.6-2.7 times gate reduction and 3.7-20.6 times speedup for 5-qubit to 8-qubit synthesis, compared to QuCT and QFAST.","tags":["quantum systems","quantum programming","synthesis","uncertainty"],"title":"Fast-USYN: Fast Synthesis from Unitary Matrices to High-Quality Quantum Circuits","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper has been accepted by Journal of Software.\nOur paper titled “Fast-USYN: Fast Synthesis from Unitary Matrices to High-Quality Quantum Circuits” (in Chinese) by Siwei Tan, Liqiang Lu, Congliang Lang, Mingshuai Chen, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for publication at the Journal of Software as part of its Special Issue on Formal Methods and Their Applications, 2025.

In this paper, we present a unified framework for the quantitative analysis of probabilistic programs, which incorporates and extends existing results on the analysis of termination, temporal properties, and expected cost. We show that these quantitative properties of a general probabilistic program can be characterized as solutions to equation systems of the corresponding Markov chain counterpart with a possibly uncountable state space. Based on such characterization, we propose sufficient conditions to establish upper and lower bounds on these quantitative properties.

To fully exploit the unlabeled graphs, researchers pre-train GNNs on large-scale graph databases and then fine-tune these pre-trained Graph Models (GMs) for better performance in downstream tasks. Because different GMs are developed with diverse pre-training tasks or datasets, they can be complementary to each other for a more complete knowledge base. Naturally, a compelling question is emerging: How can we exploit the diverse knowledge captured by different GMs simultaneously in downstream tasks? In this paper, we make one of the first attempts to exploit multiple GMs to advance the performance in the downstream tasks. More specifically, for homogeneous GMs that share the same model architecture but are obtained with different pre-training tasks or datasets, we align each layer of these GMs and then aggregate them adaptively on a per-sample basis with a tailored Recurrent Aggregation Policy Network (RAPNet). For heterogeneous GMs with different model architectures, we design an alignment module to align the output of diverse GMs and a meta-learner to decide the importance of each GM conditioned on each sample automatically before aggregating the GMs. Extensive experiments on various downstream tasks from 3 domains reveal our dominance over each single GM. Additionally, our methods (UniGM) can achieve better performance with moderate computational overhead compared to alternative approaches including ensemble and model fusion. Also, we verify that our methods are not limited to graph data but could be flexibly applied to image and text data.

The core challenge in applying abstract interpretation lies in the configuration of abstraction and analysis strategies encoded by a large number of external parameters of static analysis tools. To attain low false-positive rates (i.e., accuracy) while preserving analysis efficiency, tuning the parameters heavily relies on expert knowledge and is thus difficult to automate. In this paper, we present a fully automated framework called Parf to adaptively tune the external parameters of abstract interpretation-based static analyzers. Parf models various types of parameters as random variables subject to probability distributions over latticed parameter spaces. It incrementally refines the probability distributions based on accumulated intermediate results generated by repeatedly sampling and analyzing, thereby ultimately yielding a set of highly accurate parameter settings within a given time budget. We have implemented Parf on top of Frama-C/Eva -- an off-the-shelf open-source abstract interpretation-based static analyzer for C programs -- and compared it against the expert refinement strategy and Frama-C/Eva's official configurations over the Frama-C OSCS benchmark. Experimental results indicate that Parf achieves the lowest number of false positives on 34/37 (91.9%) program repositories with exclusively best results on 13/37 (35.1%) cases. In particular, Parf exhibits promising performance for analyzing complex, large-scale real-world programs.","tags":["static analysis","abstract interpretation","verification","parameter tuning","probabilistic algorithms"],"title":"Parf: Adaptive Parameter Refining for Abstract Interpretation","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper has been accepted for presentation at ASE 2024.\nOur paper titled “Parf: Adaptive Parameter Refining for Abstract Interpretation” by Zhongyi Wang, Linyu Yang, Mingshuai Chen, Yixuan Bu, Zhiyang Li, Qiuye Wang (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Shengchao Qin (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), Xiao Yi (Fermat Labs, Huawei Inc.), and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for presentation at ASE 2024 – the 39th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, at California, United States.

Modern theorem provers provide *structural induction* for such reasoning, but a structural induction on the original theorem is often insufficient for many equivalence theorems. In such cases, one has to invent a set of lemmas, prove these lemmas by additional induction, and use these lemmas to prove the original theorem. There is, however, a lack of systematic understanding of what lemmas are needed for inductive proofs and how these lemmas can be synthesized automatically. This paper presents *directed lemma synthesis*, an effective approach to automating equivalence proofs by discovering critical lemmas using program synthesis techniques. We first identify two *induction-friendly* forms of propositions that give formal guarantees to the progress of the proof. We then propose two tactics that synthesize and apply lemmas, thereby transforming the proof goal into induction-friendly forms. Both tactics reduce lemma synthesis to a set of independent and typically small program synthesis problems that can be efficiently solved. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: Compared to state-of-the-art equivalence checkers employing heuristic-based lemma enumeration, directed lemma synthesis saves 95.47% runtime on average and solves 38 more tasks over an extended version of the standard benchmark set.","tags":["verification","program equivalence","functional programs","synthesis","lemma finding"],"title":"Proving Functional Program Equivalence via Directed Lemma Synthesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yutao Sun","Mingshuai Chen","Kangjia Zhao","Jintao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1717545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717545600,"objectID":"01d8d99522d293625661e89ba5d90aa7","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/sun-icws-srg2024/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sun-icws-srg2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Artificial intelligence is rapidly encroaching on the field of service regulation.

Therefore, compliance with privacy regulations has increasingly become a paramount concern for both regulatory authorities and consumers. Privacy policies are crucial for consumers to understand how their personal information is collected, stored, and processed. In this work, we propose a privacy policy text compliance reasoning framework called FACTOR, which harnesses the power of large language models (LLMs). Since the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has broad applicability, this work selects GDPR Article 13 as regulation requirements. FACTOR segments the privacy policy text using a sliding window strategy and employs LLM-based text entailment to assess compliance for each segment. The framework then applies a rule-based ensemble approach to aggregate the entailment results for all regulation requirements from GDPR. Our experiments on a synthetic corpus of 388 privacy policies demonstrate the effectiveness of FACTOR. Additionally, we analyze 100 randomly selected websites offering healthcare services, revealing that 9 of them lack a privacy policy altogether, while 29 have privacy policy texts that fail to meet the regulation requirements.","tags":["service computing","service regulation","privacy policy","compliance reasoning","healthcare services","large language models"],"title":"A Privacy Policy Text Compliance Reasoning Framework with Large Language Models for Healthcare Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper has been accepted by Tsinghua Science and Technology.\nOur paper titled “A Privacy Policy Text Compliance Reasoning Framework with Large Language Models for Healthcare Services” by Jintao Chen, Fan Wang, Shengye Pang, Mingshuai Chen, Meng Xi, Tiancheng Zhao, and Jianwei Yin has been accepted for publication at the Tsinghua Science and Technology journal.

Prior approaches rely on deductive verification that shows poor scalability. Or they require exhaustive assertions that cannot ensure the program is correct for all inputs. In this paper, we propose MorphQPV, a confident assertion-based verification methodology. Our key insight is to leverage the isomorphism in quantum programs, which implies a structure-preserve relation between the program runtime states. In the assertion statement, we define a tracepoint pragma to label the verified quantum state and an assume-guarantee primitive to specify the expected relation between states. Then, we characterize the ground-truth relation between states using an isomorphism-based approximation, which can effectively obtain the program states under various inputs while avoiding repeated executions. Finally, the verification is formulated as a constraint optimization problem with a confidence estimation model to enable rigorous analysis. Experiments suggest that MorphQPV reduces the number of program executions by $107.9\\times$ when verifying the 27-qubit quantum lock algorithm and improves the probability of success by $3.3\\times$-$9.9\\times$ when debugging five benchmarks.","tags":["quantum systems","quantum programming","verification","uncertainty"],"title":"MorphQPV: Exploiting Isomorphism in Quantum Programs to Facilitate Confident Verification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Siwei Tan","Liqiang Lu","Hanyu Zhang","Jia Yu","Congliang Lang","Yongheng Shang","Xinkui Zhao","Mingshuai Chen","Yun Liang","Jianwei Yin"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1714176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714176000,"objectID":"9eb53a41e643f83f65650c50040dc79f","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/tan-asplos2024/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tan-asplos2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum readout noise turns out to be the most significant source of error, which greatly affects the measurement fidelity.

This matrices are iteratively characterized together with the calibrated probability distribution, aiming to capture the inherent locality of qubit interactions.

Applying patches is the most effective way to combat vulnerabilities. In a large scale software system, testing the presence of a security patch in every affected binary is crucial to ensure system security. Identifying whether a binary has been patched for a known vulnerability is challenging, as there may only be small differences between patched and vulnerable versions. Existing approaches mainly focus on detecting patches that are compiled in the same compiler options. However, it is common for developers to compile programs with very different compiler options in different situations, which causes inaccuracy for existing methods. In this paper, we propose a new approach named PS3, referring to precise patch presence test based on semantic-level symbolic signature. PS3 exploits symbolic emulation to extract signatures that are stable under different compiler options. Then, PS3 can test the presence of the patch precisely by comparing the signatures between the reference and the target at a semantic level.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we constructed a dataset consisting of 3,631 (CVE, binary) pairs of 62 recent CVEs in four C/C++ projects.

They intrinsically code up randomized algorithms and have long been at the heart of modern machine learning and approximate computing. We explore the theory of generating functions and investigate its usage in the exact quantitative reasoning of probabilistic programs. Important topics include the exact representation of program semantics, proving exact program equivalence, and – as our main focus in this extended abstract – exact probabilistic inference.\nIn probabilistic programming, inference aims to derive a program's posterior distribution. In contrast to approximate inference, inferring exact distributions comes with several benefits, e.g., no loss of precision, natural support for symbolic parameters, and efficiency on models with certain structures. Exact probabilistic inference, however, is a notoriously hard task. The challenges mainly arise from three program constructs: (1) unbounded while-loops and/or recursion, (2) infinite-support distributions, and (3) conditioning (via posterior observations). We present our ongoing research in addressing these challenges (with a focus on conditioning) leveraging generating functions and show their potential in facilitating exact probabilistic inference for discrete probabilistic programs.","tags":["probabilistic programs","Bayesian inference","quantitative reasoning","verification","probabilistic conditioning","semantics","generating functions","uncertainty"],"title":"Exact Probabilistic Inference Using Generating Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":[""],"categories":null,"content":"Our paper has been accepted for presentation at TACAS 2023.\nOur paper titled “Probabilistic Program Verification via Inductive Synthesis of Inductive Invariants” by Kevin Batz (RWTH Aachen), Mingshuai Chen, Sebastian Junges (Radboud), Benjamin Lucien Kaminski (Saarland/UCL), Joost-Pieter Katoen (RWTH Aachen), and Christoph Matheja (DTU) has been accepted for presentation at TACAS 2023 – the 29th International Conference on Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems at Paris, France.

Our prototypical implementation manages to automatically verify non-trivial specifications for probabilistic programs taken from the literature that -- using existing techniques -- cannot be verified without synthesizing a stronger inductive invariant first.","tags":["probabilistic programs","quantitative reasoning","verification","$k$-induction","probabilistic model checking","fixed point theory","inductive invariants","uncertainty"],"title":"Latticed $k$-Induction with an Application to Probabilistic Programs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Qiuye Wang","Mingshuai Chen","Bai Xue","Naijun Zhan","Joost-Pieter Katoen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1626307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626307200,"objectID":"6e928f4bfbf20bb45ced38e261de5e18","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/wang-cav2021/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang-cav2021/","section":"publication","summary":"A barrier certificate often serves as an inductive invariant that isolates an unsafe region from the reachable set of states, and hence is widely used in proving safety of hybrid systems possibly over the infinite time horizon. We present a novel condition on barrier certificates, termed the *invariant barrier-certificate condition*, that witnesses unbounded-time safety of differential dynamical systems. The proposed condition is by far the least conservative one on barrier certificates, and can be shown as the weakest possible one to attain inductive invariance. We show that discharging the invariant barrier-certificate condition—thereby synthesizing invariant barrier certificates—can be encoded as solving an *optimization problem subject to bilinear matrix inequalities* (BMIs). We further propose a synthesis algorithm based on difference-of-convex programming, which approaches a local optimum of the BMI problem via solving *a series of convex optimization problems*. This algorithm is incorporated in a branch-and-bound framework that searches for the global optimum in a divide-and-conquer fashion. We present a weak completeness result of our method, in the sense that a barrier certificate is guaranteed to be found (under some mild assumptions) whenever there exists an inductive invariant (in the form of a given template) that suffices to certify safety of the system. Experimental results on benchmark examples demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.","tags":["differential dynamics","hybrid systems","barrier certificates","inductive invariants","safety","reachability","verification","bilinear matrix inequalities","difference-of-convex programming","semidefinite programming"],"title":"Synthesizing Invariant Barrier Certificates via Difference-of-Convex Programming","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingshuai Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" “Induction is a process of inference; it proceeds from the known to the unknown.”\n– John S.

Previously the safety verification problem has been tackled over finite and infinite time horizons using a diverse set of approaches. The approach in this paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time bound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a negligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier certificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of safety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a finite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation over this interval.

By deriving motivation from industry practice, we define a novel network algorithm programming language (NAPL) that enhances the SDN framework with a rapid programming flow from topology-based network models to C++ implementations, thus bridging the gap between the limited capability of existing SDN APIs and the reality of practical network management. In contrast to several state-of-the-art languages, NAPL provides a range of critical high-level network programming features: (1) topology-based network modeling and visualization; (2) fast abstraction and expansion of network devices and constraints; (3) a declarative paradigm for the fast design of forwarding policies; (4) a built-in library for complex algorithm implementation; (5) full compatibility with C++ programming; and (6) user-friendly debugging support when compiling NAPL into highly readable C++ codes.

Prominent examples include automotive electronics, health care, nuclear reactors, high-speed transportations, manned spaceflight, etc., in which a malfunction of any software or hardware component would potentially lead to catastrophic consequences like significant casualties and economic losses. Meanwhile with the rapid development of feedback control, sensor techniques and computer control, time delays have become an essential feature underlying both the continuous evolution of physical plants and the discrete transition of computer programs, which may well annihilate the safety certificate and control performance of embedded systems. Traditional engineering methods, e.g., testing and simulations, are nevertheless argued insufficient for the zero-tolerance of failures incurred in time-delayed systems in a safety-critical context. Therefore, how to rigorously verify and design reliable safety-critical embedded systems involving delays tends to be a grand challenge in computer science and the control community. In contrast to delay-free systems, time-delayed systems yield substantially higher theoretical complexity thus rendering the underlying design and verification tasks significantly harder.

In contrast, the correctness and reliability of the system can be thoroughly investigated with formal design, but it requires a larger effort, which increases the development cost. Therefore, it is desirable for a designer to move between formal and informal design. This paper describes how to translate Hybrid CSP (HCSP) formal models into Simulink graphical models, so that the models can be simulated and tested using a MATLAB platform, thus avoiding expensive formal verification if the development is at a stage where it is considered unnecessary. Together with our previous work on encoding Simulink/Stateflow diagrams into HCSP, it provides a two-way path in the design of embedded systems, so that the designer can flexibly shift between formal and informal models. The translation from HCSP into Simulink diagrams is implemented as a fully automatic tool, and the correctness of the translation is justified using Unifying Theories of Programming (UTP).","tags":["differential dynamics","hybrid systems","simulation","verification","hybrid Hoare logic","hybrid CSP","UTP"],"title":"A Two-Way Path between Formal and Informal Design of Embedded Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mingshuai Chen","Martin Fränzle","Yangjia Li","Peter Nazier Mosaad","Naijun Zhan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1478563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478563200,"objectID":"367c8d186170e0d29e44a2c2ec448ca1","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/chen-fm2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen-fm2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Verification by simulation, based on covering the set of time-bounded trajectories of a dynamical system evolving from the initial state set by means of a finite sample of initial states plus a sensitivity argument, has recently attracted interest due to the availability of powerful simulators for rich classes of dynamical systems. System models addressed by such techniques involve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and can readily be extended to delay differential equations (DDEs). In doing so, the lack of validated solvers for DDEs, however, enforces the use of numeric approximations such that the resulting verification procedures would have to resort to (rather strong) assumptions on numerical accuracy of the underlying simulators, which lack formal validation or proof. In this paper, we pursue a closer integration of the numeric solving and the sensitivity-related state bloating algorithms underlying verification by simulation, together yielding a safe enclosure algorithm for DDEs suitable for use in automated formal verification. The key ingredient is an on-the-fly computation of piecewise linear, local error bounds by nonlinear optimization, with the error bounds uniformly covering sensitivity information concerning initial states as well as integration error.","tags":["differential dynamics","delay","simulation","safety","sensitivity","verification"],"title":"Validated Simulation-Based Verification of Delayed Differential Dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ting Gan","Mingshuai Chen","Yangjia Li","Bican Xia","Naijun Zhan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1467331200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467331200,"objectID":"e81e49ab498b20a563f70958e9cc426c","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/gan-ecc2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gan-ecc2016/","section":"publication","summary":"The reachability problem is one of the most important issues in the verification of hybrid systems.

To the best of our knowledge, the two families are the largest families of linear vector fields with a decidable reachability problem. In addition, we present an approach on how to abstract general linear dynamical systems to the first family. Comparing with existing abstractions for linear dynamical systems, experimental results indicate that our abstraction is more precise.","tags":["differential dynamics","hybrid systems","reachability","decidability","verification","solvable systems","Tarski's algebra"],"title":"Computing Reachable Sets of Linear Vector Fields Revisited","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ting Gan","Liyun Dai","Bican Xia","Naijun Zhan","Deepak Kapur","Mingshuai Chen"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1465689600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1465689600,"objectID":"45a50fd49f5b8914339bcecbe425e4d5","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/gan-ijcar2016/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gan-ijcar2016/","section":"publication","summary":"An algorithm for generating interpolants for formulas which are conjunctions of quadratic polynomial inequalities (both strict and nonstrict) is proposed. The algorithm is based on a key observation that quadratic polynomial inequalities can be linearized if they are concave. A generalization of Motzkin's transposition theorem is proved, which is used to generate an interpolant between two mutually contradictory conjunctions of polynomial inequalities, using semi-definite programming in time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(n^3+nm)$, where $n$ is the number of variables and $m$ is the number of inequalities (this complexity analysis assumes that despite the numerical nature of approximate SDP algorithms, they are able to generate correct answers in a fixed number of calls). Using the framework proposed by Sofronie-Stokkermans for combining interpolants for a combination of quantifier-free theories which have their own interpolation algorithms, a combination algorithm is given for the combined theory of concave quadratic polynomial inequalities and the equality theory over uninterpreted functions.","tags":["interpolation","verification","nonlinear arithmetic","semidefinite programming","synthesis"],"title":"Interpolant Synthesis for Quadratic Polynomial Inequalities and Combination with EUF","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ting Gan","Mingshuai Chen","Liyun Dai","Bican Xia","Naijun Zhan"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1448150400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1448150400,"objectID":"f0137997d25521288fc6d8c81c94ebcf","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/publication/gan-atva2015/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gan-atva2015/","section":"publication","summary":"The reachability problem is one of the most important issues in the verification of hybrid systems. Computing the reachable sets of differential equations is difficult, although computing the reachable sets of finite state machines is well developed. Hence, it is not surprising that the reachability of most of hybrid systems is undecidable. In this paper, we identify a family of vector fields and show its reachability problem is decidable. The family consists of all vector fields whose state parts are linear, while input parts are non-linear, possibly with exponential expressions. Such vector fields are commonly used in practice.To the best of our knowledge, the family is one of the most expressive families of vector fields with a decidable reachability problem.The decidability is achieved by proving the decidability of the extension of Tarski's algebra with some specific exponential functions, which has been proved by Strzeboński. In this paper, we propose another decision procedure, which is more efficient when all constraints are open sets. The experimental results indicate the efficiency of our approach, even better than existing approaches based on approximation and numeric computation in general.","tags":["differential dynamics","hybrid systems","reachability","decidability","verification","quantifier elimination","Tarski's algebra"],"title":"Decidability of the Reachability for a Family of Linear Vector Fields","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"74089d76ecfddfb12ee81afe8900fc70","permalink":"https://fiction-zju.github.io/vacancies/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/vacancies/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"}]
